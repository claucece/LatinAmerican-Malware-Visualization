## Malware music visualiser

Welcome to the malware music visualizer!

This is an app that shows in an audio and visual way how malware looks.
It takes inspiration from ['Gallery of Surveillance'](https://nex.sx/art/gallery-of-surveillance/)
by Claudio Guarneri.

## Structure

The app is manly written in javascript. It is structured as:

* The `.js` files correspond to the application rendering files.
* The `index.html` file corresponds to the html for the site.
* The `go` folder contains the Golang code used to generate hashes of a malware
  file.
* The `report` folder contains the extra documentation (design and planning)
  for this project.
* The `lib` folder contains external libraries.
* The `assests` folder contains external music files.
* The `figures` folder contains the art to be displayed.
